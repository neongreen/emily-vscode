# Emily VSCode

A VS Code extension that cycles through emojis in markdown headers.

## Features

- Cycle through configured emojis in markdown headers
- Customizable emoji list through settings
- Works with all markdown header levels (#, ##, ###, etc.)

## Usage

1. Open a markdown file
2. Place your cursor on a header line (e.g., `# My Header`)
3. Run the command "Cycle Emoji in Header" (you can bind this to a keyboard shortcut)
4. The extension will cycle through your configured emojis:
   - First press: Adds the first emoji (`# ‚òê My Header`)
   - Second press: Replaces with second emoji (`# ‚ùå My Header`)
   - Continue cycling through all emojis
   - After the last emoji, it removes all emojis and goes back to plain header

## Configuration

You can customize the emojis by adding this to your VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "emily.emojis": ["‚òê", "‚ùå", "üü¢", "üü°", "üî¥"]
}
```
